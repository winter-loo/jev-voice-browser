# voice-browser — talk to a real browser, it acts before you finish the sentence

A Node app that controls a **real Chromium window via native CDP** (Chrome DevTools Protocol on port 9229) by voice.
Speech is streamed either directly from the **browser microphone (48kHz s16le PCM via Web Audio API + WebSocket)** or from a local **Doubao Voice Bridge** (TCP 4387 & TCP 5004); on every partial transcript the server asks **Jev** (TypeSafe's System One model, `jev-1.13.0`) one request with a dozen typed questions — intent, target element, site, "is the command complete?", "is this even addressed to me?", "is it destructive?" — gets typed probabilities back in ~250–350 ms, and code decides whether to act, wait, ask, or ignore.

Jev never generates text. Search queries, typed text and URLs are extracted as candidate spans by code and Jev only *picks* one, which is copied verbatim. Both English and Chinese voice commands are supported.

## Run it

Requirements: Node ≥ 20 (tested on 22), npm, a running Chrome with CDP enabled (`--remote-debugging-port=9229`), and Doubao Voice Bridge (or the browser microphone). Real API calls cost ~$0.0002 each.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/winter-loo/jev-voice-browser.git
cd jev-voice-browser
npm install
cp .env.example .env          # paste your TypeSafe API key (https://console.typesafe.ai/keys)
./run.sh                      # starts the server on http://localhost:8787
```

### Start Chrome with CDP on port 9229

```bash
# macOS
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9229

# Linux / Windows
google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9229
```

Then open **http://localhost:8787** (or `http://<server-ip>:8787` from another LAN machine) in any browser, click **Start Mic Stream**, allow the microphone, and speak. The server captures 48kHz PCM, routes it to Doubao Voice Bridge, feeds Jev in real time, and controls your 9229 Chrome window.

Options: `./run.sh --port 8787 --cdp http://127.0.0.1:9229 --doubao-port 4387 --doubao-audio-port 5004`

Set the key yourself instead of `.env`: `export TYPESAFE_API_KEY=…` (legacy `JEV_API_KEY` is
also accepted) and `npm start`. The key is only ever read by the Node process; the control page
never sees it.

**Security:** the server listens on `127.0.0.1` only by default. Anyone who can reach the control port can
drive the browser and spend your API credits, so only use `--host 0.0.0.0` on a network you trust.
Destructive clicks require a spoken "confirm", but treat that as a convenience, not a guarantee.

No microphone? Type a command into the text box on the control page and press Enter.

## What you can say

| Say | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| "go to wikipedia" / "open youtube" / "go to example dot com" | navigates (site list or spoken domain, code owns the URLs) |
| "search for alan turing" | uses the page's own search box if it has one (Wikipedia, YouTube…), else DuckDuckGo |
| "search youtube for lofi beats" | site-specific search URL template |
| "click the first result" / "click the new link" / "open the comments tab" | clicks the element Jev picked from the snapshot; ambiguous → numbered overlays, say "two" |
| "type hello world into the search box" | types verbatim (Jev picked the span, code copies it) |
| "scroll down a bit" / "scroll to the bottom" / "scroll up a page" | scroll with amount from a 3-level Score |
| "go back" / "go forward" / "reload" | history |
| "open a new tab" / "close this tab" / "next tab" | tabs |
| "click place order" | destructive → toast asks you to say **"confirm"** (or "cancel") |
| "so anyway I think we should get lunch" | ignored (`is_command` ≈ 0.02) |

Two commands in one breath work too: "go to example dot com and click the more information link".

## How a decision is made

Every transcript update produces exactly one Jev request (`src/jev.js`). State:

```json
{ "transcript": "click the first result",
  "page": { "url": "...", "title": "...", "site": "duckduckgo" },
  "elements": ["e02 combobox \"jev typesafe\" (placeholder: Search privately)", "e20 link \"TypeSafe — Jev\" → typesafe.ai", "..."] }
```

Questions (all in `src/constants.js`, asked together, answered in parallel):

| id | type | answers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `intent` | Choice | navigate_url · search_web · click_element · type_into_field · select_option · press_enter · scroll_down/up · go_back/forward · reload · open/close/switch tab · confirm · cancel · none — each option has `{what, not_for, examples}` |
| `target` | Choice | the element ids on the page + `none` |
| `site` | Choice | google · duckduckgo · the_web · youtube · wikipedia · github · amazon · reddit · twitter_x · hacker_news · example_com · other_named_site · none |
| `complete` | Noul | has the user finished the command? (lets us act on partial speech) |
| `is_command` | Noul | is the user addressing the browser at all? |
| `destructive` | Noul | would it submit / buy / delete / send? |
| `scroll_amount` | Score | a little · one page · to the end |
| `text_span` | Choice | verbatim candidate spans extracted by regex (+ `none`) — only when the transcript has any |
| `url_span` | Choice | domain-looking spans (+ `none`) — only when present |
| `tab_direction` | Choice | next · previous · first · none |

Policy (`src/policy.js`, thresholds `T` in `constants.js`), shown live in the UI as a gate table:

1. `is_command ≥ 0.5` else **ignore**
2. `intent.confidence ≥ 0.55` and not `none` else **wait**
3. `complete ≥ 0.6`, or 900 ms of silence, or the recognizer's final result — else **wait**
4. free-text intents (search / type) additionally wait for the final result or 600 ms silence, so a
   query is never truncated ("search for alan" vs "search for alan turing")
5. build the action in code: URL templates, search-box fallback, verbatim span copy
6. click/type targets need `target.confidence ≥ 0.45` and top probability ≥ 0.35, else the top 2–3
   candidates get numbered overlays in the page and a spoken number picks one (no model call)
7. `destructive ≥ 0.5` on a click → **confirm** (say "confirm" / "cancel")

Requests overlap: up to 2 in flight; older ones are cancelled with `AbortSignal`. A response for a
partial transcript may still act if the words already commit to a closed-set action ("go back"),
but is never treated as final for free text.

## Project layout

```
src/constants.js   MODEL pin, thresholds, every question text — the one file to review on camera
src/jev.js         builds state + questions, calls @typesafe-ai/sdk, returns answers/latency/usage/cost
src/spans.js       candidate extraction (text payloads, spoken URLs, number words) — code, not Jev
src/snapshot.js    in-page element collector (tags data-vb-id), compaction + size guard, site detection
src/policy.js      answers → act / wait / ignore / confirm / disambiguate, with reasons
src/cdp.js         lightweight native CDP client (ws/http) for Chrome communication
src/doubao.js      TCP client for Doubao Voice Bridge (TCP 4387 control, TCP 5004 audio)
src/executor.js    CDP actions + overlay feedback
src/browser.js     native CDP page/tab manager attached to port 9229
src/overlay.js     injected highlight / toast / numbered badges
src/controller.js  debounce, in-flight management, one action per utterance, chaining, stats
src/server.js      Express + ws, serves src/public/index.html (control page) & bridges mic audio
scripts/demo.js    word-by-word replay against real sites = end-to-end test
test/unit/         spans, snapshot compaction, policy (mocked Jev), controller (mocked Jev + browser)
test/integration/  27 real-API cases on captured page fixtures, prints pass rate + latency
```

## Tests and demo

```bash
npm test                 # unit tests (no network)
npm run test:integration # real Jev calls on fixtures; prints pass rate (expects ≥ 90%)
npm run demo             # headed replay of 16 spoken commands against real sites, asserts URLs
npm run demo:ci          # same, headless; exit code 1 on failure
node scripts/demo.js --headless --only 1,2,3 --word-ms 250
```

Latest measured (Sep 2026, from this machine): integration 27/27 (100%), Jev latency avg ≈ 330 ms
(p50 ≈ 300 ms, 3–6k input tokens per request; the first request of a process is ~700 ms for the
TLS handshake), last-word→decision ≈ 300 ms including the 200 ms debounce, whole demo ≈ $0.01.

## Notes and limitations

- Web Speech API only in Chrome/Edge; it sends audio to Google. Interim results arrive in bursts, so
  "acting before you finish" is most visible on longer sentences.
- One action per utterance; extra words after an executed command are treated as a new command
  only if there are at least two of them.
- Element snapshot is capped at 100 items (viewport first) and 60 chars of text each — deep pages
  need a scroll before "click …" finds below-fold items. Elements inside iframes are not seen.
- Sites with heavy bot protection (Google consent, some search engines in headless mode) may not
  render results; the demo uses Wikipedia, example.com, Hacker News and DuckDuckGo.
- `select_option` matches the option label in code by substring; `switch_tab` cycles.
- Confidence gates are calibrated on `jev-1.13.0`; re-check `T` if you move the model alias.
